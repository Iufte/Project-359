# Project-359
Honours Project Vicente Trelles - University of Edinburgh (2017-2020)

Hello. My name is Vicente Trelles Fern√°ndez.
This repository contains the piece of code I have utilized as part of my Hounours Project (Project 359), named COB

In order to use COB, please locate the file containing this code in the same folder
as the FASTA file containing the DNA sequence you wish to analyse

Then simply run the code

The cosole will ask you to input the name of the file containing the sequence.
Type the name of your file. COB reads text files only.
Make sure to include the file extension (for example, .txt) at the end of the name.
Press ENTER
The output will be displayed

I hope this tool may be useful for your own research on 359 synthesis
