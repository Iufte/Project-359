#     Hello. My name is Vicente Trelles FernÃ¡ndez.

#     This file contains the piece of code I have utilized as part of my Hounours Project (Project 359), named COB

#     In order to use COB, please locate the file containing this code in the same folder
#     as the FASTA file containing the DNA sequence you wish to analyse

#     Then simply run the code

#     The python cosole will ask you to input the name of the file containing the sequence.
#     Type the name of your file. COB reads text files only.
#     Make sure to include the file extension (for example, .txt) at the end of the name.
#     Press ENTER
#     The output will be displayed

#     I hope this tool may be useful for your own research on 359 synthesis
